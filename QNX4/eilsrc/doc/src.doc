Changes to Eils source.

1) Libraries
They are:
	eillib/eillib.h: src general purpose. e.g. msg*(), break*(), get_priv()
	das/das.h: DAS general purpose. e.g. cc*()
	dbr/dbr.h: DBR guts. e.g. dc*(), dg*(), db*()
	dbr_mod/dbr_mod.h DBR module general purpose. e.g. file/frame()

They were:
	das_utils/das_utils.h-> now split into das and eillib
	dbr_utils/dbr_utils.h->now linked to dbr/dbr.h
	mod_utils/mod_utils.h->now linked to dbr_mod/dbr_mod.h

A library has been built called das_utils/das_utils.h which contains
all of das and eillib, however it will not be maintained.

2) Source Changes
	a) all *_options (msg_init_options etc) do not reset optind to 0
	after they are done scanning the options. If you check for options
	special to your program, be sure and reset optind before you do so.
	( That was the memo problem, it didnt even see the slay option.)

	b) If you include sol.h in any of your programs (it defines how to
	(un)register a proxy with soldrv, you should instead include
	soldrv.h.

3) Executable Changes
	soldrv3 and solfmt3 are linked to soldrv and solfmt.
	The old ones are gone.
