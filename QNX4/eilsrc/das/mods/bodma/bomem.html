<H1>Bomem Seq36 Card QNX Driver (Bodma)</H1>
The Bomem Driver (Bodma) provides software data collection capability and
control for the Bomem Seq36 Card which is an ISA PC/AT card that interfaces
to the Bomem Michelson series spectrometer via an RS422-like connection and
uses DMA to transfer data to the computer. Bodma can interface to standard
ARP data acquisition modules including Memo, CmdCtrl, Command Servers and
TMC Data Collection.<P>

Bodma requires at least QNX 4.23 to run since it uses this operating system's
thread capability. Bodma requires an IRQ, DMA Channel and IO Port Address
which are specified both as jumpers on the board and as program command line
arguments. The jumper locations on the board are marked IRQ, DMA and the IO
Port is set by jumpers 10, and 11 as follows:<BR>
(Bomem sets this map specially for us)<BR>
JMP11 JMP12 Addr<BR>
in    in    220h<BR>
in    out   300h<BR>
out   in    3A0h<BR>
out   out   3A0h<BR>

<P>
For program command line arguments see the usage for bodma for more
information. (i.e. type 'use bodma' at the QNX prompt).<P>

When first invoked, bodma can interface with DAS modules Memo, CmdCtrl and
Collection. Specifics of these interfaces an be set with command line
arguments. (Again see the usage).<P>

Bodma can also run by itself in test mode. In this mode, Bodma prompts
itself to collect data at a regular rate instead of being commanded to
collect. (See usage).<P>

Bodma logs data interferograms (IR) from the spectrometer in files and
directories, the names and directory structure of which corrospond to
ordinary DAS ARP logged data files. Each bomem data file contains one
coadded IR pair (sequence) with a header as follows:
<UL>
<LI>BYTE1 version: Data File structure version
<LI>UBYTE2 seq: Sequence Number, File Number
<LI>UBYTE4 time: Time in seconds of data
<LI>BYTE4 scans: Number of scans in Coadd
<LI>UBYTE4 npts: Number of points
<LI>BYTE1 david_code: Special User Code
<LI>BYTE1 david_pad[8]: Special User String
</UL>

With the initialization complete, the driver will register it's 
name (bodma) with the operating system, signaling other processes
that the initialization was successful and advertising it's services.<P>

At this point, the driver enters server mode where it waits in a
Receive() loop, waiting for incoming requests. The driver handles user
requests for data and features with the following Request Message Structure:
<UL>
<LI>BYTE1 hdr: Seq36, defined in bodma.h 
<LI>BYTE2 scans: >0 : double IR, # scans/coadd; <0 : stop current acquisition
<LI>UBYTE2 runs: Number of Measurements
<LI>BYTE1 zpd: ~0 : Turn On ZPD computing; 0: Turn Off ZPD computing
<LI>BYTE1 david_code: Set Special Code for bomem data file header
<LI>BYTE1 david_pad[8]: Set Special String for bomem data file header
</UL>

The data to be reported to telemetry include:
<UL>
<LI>Bodma Status Frame
<LI>Bodma Data Info Frame
</UL>

Any or both of these bodma frames may be reported in telemetry. The rate at 
which these two data frames is collected and/or reported is entirely 
determined by the TMC program.<P>

The Bodma Status Frame is 1 byte with the following Status Bits set when true:
<UL>
<LI>Bit 0: Driver Installed & Initialised
<LI>Bit 1: Driver Servicing an Acquisition Run Request
<LI>Bit 2: Driver Acquired a Sequence Measurement (A Coadd, 1 File)
<LI>Bit 3: Driver Logging a Sequence Measurement
<LI>Bit 4: Penultimate Scan in Coadd Occurred, CLEARED ON NEXT REQUESTED SEQUENCE
<LI>Bit 5: ZPD Computation On, SET ON NEXT REQUESTED SEQUENCE
</UL>

The Bodma Data Info Frame is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>UBYTE2 seq: Sequence number of file
<LI>BYTE4 scans: Number of scans in requested sequence
<LI>BYTE4 A_l_zpd_pos: Channel A Location of max ZPD of 1st IR
<LI>BYTE4 A_l_zpd_neg: Channel A Location of min ZPD of 1st IR
<LI>float A_zpd_pos: Channel A max ZPD value of 1st IR
<LI>float A_zpd_neg: Channel A min ZPD value of 1st IR
<LI>BYTE4 B_l_zpd_pos: Channel B Location of max ZPD of 1st IR
<LI>BYTE4 B_l_zpd_neg: Channel B Location of min ZPD of 1st IR
<LI>float B_zpd_pos: Channel B max ZPD value of 1st IR
<LI>float B_zpd_neg: Channel B min ZPD value of 1st IR
</UL>
