Joe,						January 13, 1990

I'm pretty close to plugging this sucker in.  I've juggled the
addresses a little since the first doc I dropped on your desk.  I'm up
to "Jan. 13" so far.  The additions I need are listed below.  Should I
undertake these myself, or would it make more sense for someone else
to do so?  (You've probably got the best view to determine that.)

We are planning to have CMDENBL fed back to the input port, but I
noticed that we have a couple free input pins on the high 8255 (PC1
and PC2).  It might be just a little neater to take CMDENBL to PC1 and
leave a full 8 bits going to the connector.  By the same token, can
you think of any other single signal which would be helpful as a
diagnostic which we could send to PC2.  Actually, we could leave it
open and jumper signals to it for scope-less diagnostics.

Finally, I see some difficulty in getting the Ampro system up with
this board.  You've got it configured with a disk adapter and a
display adapter, but this card only has one slot.  I don't see offhand
how we can do without either of those cards, but maybe I'm missing
something.

The prom programs have been written, and I'm beginning to lay out
diagnostic routines, but I could move directly to powering up if
possible.

Changes as of Jan. 13, 1990:

 1. Chip select on the high 8255 needs to be qualified with SBHE from
    the AT backplane.

 2. CMDENBL/ as present on the ICC backplane needs to be fed back to
    an input port (I suggest PC1 on U12, pin 15).

 3. The reset circuit needs some additional gates to prevent an
    extremely narrow reset pulse.

Drawings of these additions are attached.
