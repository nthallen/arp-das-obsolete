p2das is a project to provide access to selected features
of the Anderson Group Data Acquisition Architecture from
perl. The strategy is not to link in the bulk of nortlib
into perl, but rather to provide these features in a smaller
executable that perl can communicate with via the QNX module's
Send function.

This project will consist of at least two parts:

  P2DAS.pm (et.al.?) the Perl library

  p2das the executable
    -d initialize connection with da_cache
	-n name
	-c <n> reserve n bytes of command data

Functions to be supported include:
  Write and/or Read to da_cache
  Interface with msg functions
  Attach a name and accept command data

  P2DAS::Cache( $waddr, $wdata, $raddr, $data );
  
Message Format
  Multiple commands can be included in each message
  typedef struct {
    unsigned short hdr; /* 'PD' */
    unsigned short total_length;
  } p2d_hdr;
  typedef struct {
	unsigned short cmd;
	unsigned short length;
	unsigned char data[0];
  } p2d_cmd;
  typedef struct {
	unsigned short status;
	unsigned short length;
	unsigned char data[0];
  } p2d_reply;
  
  The Reply is similar: each command returns a status and a
  length followed by any data.
  
  cmd codes include
    1 Write to da_cache, specifying address, length and data
	2 Write to command data, specifying offset, length and data
	3 Send message to msg, specifying level, length and text
	8 Read from da_cache, specifying address and length
	9 Read from command data, specifying offset and length
   10 Read from command data, blocking until new data arrives,
	  specifying offset and length
