Timeout strategy:
  A/D will recover from timeouts after 1000 retries.
  In normal operation where approximately 100 channels are being
  read once per second, this will retry a timeout in about 10
  seconds.
  
  GC will not automatically recover from a timeout. The client
  program will have to issue a tt_gc_reset() command.
  
  I won't spend any more effort on timeouts. At the moment I
  am satisfied that the driver and the client will not "lock up"
  if the boards are powered down. The driver will even continue
  to operate reasonably. The clients may need to be shutdown and
  restarted, but what do you expect if you power down your
  boards?
