<package> subbus_opt

<comment>
  This package doesn't complain if the subbus is not resident,
  but will complain with nl_error(3) if any subbus routines are
  called if the library is not resident.

<include> subbus
<follow> subbus

<include> "nortlib.h"

<defs>
  void far sbsnload(void) {
	nl_error(3, "Subbus access while not resident or not loaded");
  }
