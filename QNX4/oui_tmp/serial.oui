<comment>
  Package for utilities accessing serial ports
  Applicaiton must define serial_fd in a package called serial_init
  I am unfamiliar with the use, so I haven't provided a default.

<follow> serial_init

<opts> "t:"
<sort>
	-t <device stty operands string> null string "" to leave as is

<include> "serial.h"
<var>
  int serial_fd;

<init>
  serial_init_options(argc, argv, serial_fd);
