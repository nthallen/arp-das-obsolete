	Implement Command Queueing {
	  Each drive has a command queue
	  Each drive has a scan recorder.
	  An "Stop" command will clear the queue, halt an
		existing scan or drive.
	  All other commands will be queued until the
		previous command for that drive has finished executing.
		Drives are finished when status bit says all clear or
		when the interrupt is seen. Scans are finished when
		they are finished. All other commands execute immediately.
		Institute a slow poll whenever anything needs checking,
		but try to use the proxies for best effect
