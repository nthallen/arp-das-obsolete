This is just a summary of how an Inet-based doit must work:

check for def of RemoteHost, Experiment
RemEx=$Experiment
Experiment=$Experiment.IN
rm -f Inet.ports
Inetin
  picks port #, resolves hostname
  writes line to Inet.ports, then forks and exits
s: InetSrvr
s:   picks port #, resolves hostname
s:   writes line to Inet.ports, then forks and exits
until rsh $RemoteHost InetBridge $RemEx `cat Inet.ports`; do
  echo rsh failed, retrying
  (or could check locally for DG...)
done
echo Waiting for local DG
s: echo Waiting for local CmdServer
echo Proceeding
rm -f Inet.ports
