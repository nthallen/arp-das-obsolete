This document is intended to summarize the label mappings for
use by key handlers. Most dialogs are labeled with a short sequence
of letters. The first letter identifies the handler. This allows
some modularity in the program, since a new module does not have
to be directly supported inside existing handlers. Subsequent
letters in the label may be used by the specific handler to
determine the nature of the request.
