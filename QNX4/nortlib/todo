nl_cons {
  nlcon_display should not be in coninit.c
  The subroutine which interleaves attributes should be
  separated out so it can be used by nlcons_display also.
  nlcons_display might be added to the library...
  Con_init_options could accept info only up to a colon {
	-A /dev/con1:24 -a /dev/con2:22
	Anything after the colon could be application-specific.
  }
}
