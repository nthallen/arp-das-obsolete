extract {
  When a large number of extractions are run, the script can 
  terminate before the extraction hierarchy has been properly
  dismantled. How to address this is tricky: probably start
  memo, then spawn a sub-shell to start up rdr and the 
  extractions, then exec parent to wait for the termination...
  I think that would work

  Use rsh to {
	if .CKSUM exists, run dircksum <flight>
	else run dircksum -w <flight>
	write results to a specific file
	retry if the file is not found
  }
  +Don't archive if DiskID is not defined
  +Add RemoteHost and RemoteDir (defaulting to HomeDir) {
	Separate remote host from remote path at ':'
	if no ':' in path, remote host is $RemoteHost
	if no leading '/' in path, prefix with RemoteDir or HomeDir
	Put it back together
  }
}
archive {
  if .CKSUM exists, run dircksum
  else run dircksum -w
  Fail if either fails
