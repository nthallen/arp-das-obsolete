This archive contains a Perl module to provide basic native QNX
IPC from within Perl. Specifically, it supports
Send/Receive/Reply, proxy functions and Trigger, and
name_attach/detach/locate.

Version 0.02 fixed a gross memory leak in 0.01 :-Q
Version 0.03 adds psinfo, vc_attach/detach, getnid and
net_alive. Also updated to compile with Perl-5.6.0
Version 0.05 removed some inefficient memory allocation.

If you are interested in expanding this module, please let us know.

To compile, you must first have perl installed. Then do as you
would with any perl module: Start by unpacking the archive:

     zcat perl-QNX-0.05.tgz | pax -rv
     cd QNX-0.05

Then:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

and to install the new version of perl with the extensions:

     make install
     make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl
