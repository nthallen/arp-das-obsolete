How to expand subbus functionality: {
  Add new function to subbus.asm
  Provide either a version increment or a function bit to identify
   that the new function is supported. Clearly document what
   conditions indicate the function is supported. (set_cmdstrobe
   is documented in subbus.asm: doc should probably go in subbus.h
   or on the web documentation...)
  In subbus.asm, be sure to add entry in table of function pointers
  modify subbus.h to reflect the additional entry
  In submain.c add code to convert the new pointer properly
  Recompile both the resident and non-resident libraries.
}
Error in subbus.asm {
  qtick doesn't queue requests properly for ticking.
  Affects DOS!
}
Subbus {
  Need to maintain functional compatability, but not binary
  compatability, since no previous QNX4 binaries exist.
  Not entirely true: may want to back-port to DOS...
  Add feature word with bits for individual features.
  Minimize use of data area: {
	Eliminate stupid counts which aren't really supported.
	Consider implementing some functions via messages {
	  tick and tick_check
	}
  }
}
To handle shared library {
  Client must {
	Locate Server via name (huarp/subbus)
	call qnx_segment_arm(subbus_pid, -1, 0);
	Send to Server to request information
  }
  Server must {
	attach the name (huarp/subbus)
	Receive from Clients
	call qnx_segment_put(Clients_pid, my_cs, 0);
	paste-up far pointers using the resulting segment
	reply with the whole structure
	Data segment must be made global, so it can be referenced
	from any.
  }
