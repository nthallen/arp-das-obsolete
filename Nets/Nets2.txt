What would I need in a TM/Wiring database?
Suppose I defined the database to facilitate top-down design
(and/or bottom up?)
Define

component_type
  component_type_id
  component_desc
  comptype_first_rev
  comptype_cur_rev
connector_type
  connector_type_id
  connector_type_name
  connector_npins
  connector_mfr
  connector_dwg
connector
  connector_id
  component_type_id
  connector_type_id
  connector_gender
pin
  pin_id
  connector_type_id
  pin_order
  pin_name
interconn_signal
  interconn_id
  component_type_id
  interconn_mnc
interconnect
  interconn_id
  connector_id # must have same component_type_id as interconn_id
  pin_id # must have same connector_type_id as connector_id
  valid_from
  valid_thru
component_type_history
  component_type_id
  date
  revision
  description

instrument
  instrument_id
  instrument_mnc
  instrument_name
  instrument_desc
subsystem
  subsystem_id
  instrument_id
  subsystem_mnc
  subsystem_desc
component
  component_id
  subsystem_id
  instrument_id (redundant?)
  component_type_id
  component_mnc
  component_subdesc
cable
measurement (associated with one or more signals)
  measurement_id
  subsystem_id
  description
signal
  measurement_id
  signal_id
  Sch_Label
  Mnemonic (default to the same)

Look at how addresses are assigned in Nets

How do we handle updates?
Should retain history
Most of interconnect is recorded in the component type,
but when it comes to making modifications, you generally
modify a component, not a type. Of course having a record
of the changes made to a component is very useful. Can
these be easily represented as changes to the interconnect?
For the most part, although there may be some functional changes on
the component that would need to be recorded somewhere else.
