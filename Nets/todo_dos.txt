
Aliasing {
  Process the alias and generate the cabling definitions
  Alias is stored with the comp, not the comptype.
  $SIGNAL::comp->{comp}->alias->{conn}
  Use alias to determine the cable name and define the cable table
}
Limit checking to a single component {
  Put specification in nets.ini
  Components=
}
txt2ili [directory] {
  If directory is not specified, look in Registry, else
  look in current directory for nets.ini else fail
  If we found dir by means other than Registry, record the
  directory in the Registry.
}
How do I decide which project I'm working on?
The Registry is the obvious answer, so then I need
a utility to update the Registry.
All I need to specify is a directory. In that directory, I would store
a file nets.ini that would define {
  xls_file
  viewlogic_project_file
  etc.
  This information would all get stored in the database, so the
  .ini wouldn't be needed after txt2ili
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\HUARP\Nets\BaseDir
