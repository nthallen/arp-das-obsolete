This is a development directory for test builds of of the
telemetry architecture. Some things here will be moved into
various libraries as development proceeds.

Current Bugs
  DCtap does not seem to get initial timestamp even though a
   simple cat of DCf does.
  Startup MFCtr reads zero twice: probably poorly set
   next_minor_frame.
